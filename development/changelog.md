#### 2024.06.20
The Deposit Fee system has become available in Hungary, for which we created new API Resources and expanded old ones.

**New API Resources:**<br>

**1. Creating a Deposit:** `Product Addon Resource`<br>
- **Function:**  This API Resource allows the creation of deposits in the system.
- **Data:** All necessary data for each deposit is defined here, such as amount, type, VAT.<br>

**2. Linking Deposit with Product:** `Product Addon Product Relation Resource`<br>

- **Function**`: This API Resource is responsible for linking deposits and products.

- **Opportunity:** It allows adding the appropriate deposit to a given product.<br>

**3. Ordered Deposits:** `Order Product Addon Resource`<br>

- **Function:** This API Resource is used for managing the deposits ordered during the ordering process.<br>

- **Information:** It provides information about the ordered deposits and ensures their tracking in the order process.<br>

Extending existing API Resources with Product Addon information:

- [Order Resource](../api/order.md)

- [Order Extend Resource](../api/order_extend.md)

- [Product Resource](../api/product.md)

- [Product Extend Resource](../api/product_extend.md)

- [Webhook](../api/webhook.md)

#### 2024.04.12
The Shipping Additional Cost fields have been added to Webhook Resource. [Webhook Resource](../api/webhook.md)

#### 2024.04.11
Limited discount fields were added to Product Special Resource. [Product Special Resource](../api/product_special.md)

#### 2024.03.16
We have fixed the encoding of special characters used in the shipping and billing addresses associated with orders in API requests.

The following setting has been added to the [Settings Resource](../api/setting.md):

- **config_mobile_simple_snapshot** - Simplified mobile product card
- **config_number_of_columns_in_category_page** - Number of products per row on category page in desktop view
- **config_number_of_columns_in_category_page_in_mobile** - Number of products per row on category page in mobile view
- **config_search_dropdown** - Enable dropdown search module

#### 2024.03.11
All Shipping Mode has become queryable from the Shipping Mode Extend Resource. [Shipping Mode Extend Resource](../api/shipping_mode_extend.md) But the 'extension' field is still read-only!

#### 2024.01.17
The Wolt Shipping mode has been added to the possible values of shippingMethodExtension [Order Extend Resource](../api/order_extend.md)

#### 2024.01.03
If we added a product to an order through the admin interface and then queried the order via the API using the [Order Product Resource](../api/order_product.md), we might have observed that the product appeared in the query without price. We have fixed this issue.

#### 2023.11.09
Deleting the default customer group will no longer be possible via API requests. The response code will be "400 The default customer group cannot be deleted."

The maximum identifier for orders created via API requests can be the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer (2,147,483,647). Order identifiers greater than this number will not be generated in the system.

#### 2023.10.02
The following setting has been added to the [Settings Resource](../api/setting.md):
<br>**config_display_quantity_name** - Unit of measurement appears on the product page after the input field.

#### 2023.09.28
Two new shipping methods were added: Sameday shipping and Easybox parcel locker. These methods' values are the following: SAMEDAYSHIPPING and EASYBOX.

#### 2023.09.26
We translated the whole developer documentation to english.

#### 2023.09.05
We made it easier to retrieve and manage parent-child product relationships in the Shoprenter API. Filtering has become possible in the [Product](../api/product.md) and [ProductExtend](../api/product_extend.md) resources. Specifying `parentProductId` as a parameter in the filter returns products with the same `parentProductId`.

If we deleted a manufacturer using the [Manufacturer](../api/manufacturer.md) Resource, the corresponding search-friendly url value remained in the database and could be queried. Thanks to a fix, when the manufacturer is deleted, the corresponding url will also be deleted.

#### 2023.09.04
The following setting has been added to the Setting Resource:
- **config_display_quantity_in_category** - Display the quantity field on the category page when shopping.

#### 2023.08.21
In the event that textual content was deleted using the [CMS Extend](../api/cms_content_extend.md) Resource, the corresponding search-friendly url value remained in the database and could be queried. Thanks to a fix, when text content is deleted, the associated url will also be deleted.

#### 2023.08.05
If a category was deleted using the [Category Extend](../api/category_extend.md) Resource, the corresponding search-friendly url value remained in the database and could be queried. Thanks to a fix, when you delete the category, the corresponding url will also be deleted.

#### 2023.08.01
If we try to delete a property several times with the DELETE method, after each request the API returns a status code of 204, i.e. a successful deletion. According to this bugfix, the API will return a 204 response code only after the first successful deletion, and all subsequent deletion requests will return with a 404 response code.

#### 2023.07.10
[Order](../api/order.md) and [OrderExtended](../api/order_extend.md) resource added a new optional field `externalInfo`. This field contains two required parameters: `partner_order_id` and `partner_prefix`.
These identifiers can be useful if an order placed on an external marketplace (e.g. Emag marketplace) is also created in the Shoprenter web store using an API. If these identifiers are entered for the order, it is also possible to search for them on the order list page.

#### 2023.05.23
We have created the [Reload Order Url resource](../api/reload_order_url.md). This resource can be used to create a unique url for incomplete orders (Abandoned carts).

#### 2023.05.10
In the case of [Product List Attribute Value Relation Resource](../api/product_list_attribute_value_relation.md), we have improved the use of the “page” parameter and from now on the results of all pages can be queried.

#### 2023.03.29
We expanded the content of [webhooks](../paymentapi/docs/l_notifications.md) that notify app developers. The reason for sending is now also included in the webhooks that we send when a subscription is stopped.

We have improved the functionality of [Payment plans](../paymentapi/docs/h_plan.md) that can be defined by app developers. Now, if the price or name of the Payment plan changes, the existing app subscriptions will be renewed with the changes.

#### 2023.03.01
We have expanded the possible values of [Order extend resource](../api/order_extend.md) and [Order resource](../api/order.md) with an additional option:

- **shippingMethodExtension** - Foxpost home delivery and Foxpost
  parcel machine value has been improved.

#### 2023.01.02
We expanded the [Script Tag resource](../api/script_tag.md) parameters with an additional option:
- **displayArea** - This field shows exactly where the script used in the call was or can be placed.

#### 2023.01.27
We have expanded the events that can be added to [WebHook resource](../api/webhook.md) with three additional options:
- newsletter subscription (newsletter_subscribe)
- newsletter unsubscribe (newsletter_unsubscribe)
- change newsletter subscriber data (newsletter_update_subscriber)

#### 2022.12.23
We have improved the functionality of the 'onCheckoutInitiated' event to ensure that it activates at the beginning of the checkout process.

#### 2022.11.30
A new search parameter has been added to the [Order](../api/order.md) and [OrderExtend](../api/order_extend.md) Resources called "innerIdMin".\

#### 2022.11.21
Fix WebHook Resource Parameters.\
From now on [WebHook Resource](../api/webhook.md) "page", "limit" and "full" Parameters can be used properly. These were indicated in the documentation as such before, however, it was not possible to use them, we fixed this problem.

Customer Group Product Price Resource change.\
When using [Customer Group Product Price Resource](../api/customer_group_product_price.md) "customerGroup" and "product" are now required properties. Without specifying them, it is not possible to create customer group product prices. This requirement is also stated in the developer documentation. It is not mandatory to enter them when changing the resource.
